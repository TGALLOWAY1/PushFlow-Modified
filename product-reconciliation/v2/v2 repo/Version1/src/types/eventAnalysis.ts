 * - Event → AnalyzedEvent (grouped moment containing multiple simultaneous notes)
 * - Transition → Transition (links two consecutive events with movement metrics)
 * - FingerMove → FingerMove (represents a single finger movement between events)
 * - OnionSkinModel → OnionSkinModel (complete context for onion skin visualization)
